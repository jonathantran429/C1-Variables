#Data Types/Variable Types:
#String (str) : combination of characters (letters, numbers, or symbols, must use quotation marks)
#Integer (int) : whole numbers
#Characters (Char) : single letter, number, or symbol, use apostrophes
#Float : numbers with decimals
#Boolean (boo) : True/False statements

#formula:
#variableName = value
#Rules for variable names
#1. always start with a letter

#3. if more than one word is used, use camelCase (first word is lowercase and every word after that is uppercase)
